# Golang-CVE-2021-22205-POC
A CVE-2021-22205 Gitlab RCE POC written in Golang

I've been wanting to learn Golang for a while. I decided to write a POC for CVE-2021-22205 in Golang to help familiarize myself with the language. Please disregard what I am assuming is horribly written code.

Usage: ```go run CVE-2021-22205.go -t http://127.0.0.1:8080 -c "echo pizza > /tmp/pizza.txt"```

The script is setup to use http://localhost:9090 as a proxy. You'll need to delete that, if you don't want to use a proxy.
